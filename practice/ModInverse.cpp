/*Theory:
What is modular multiplicative inverse? If you have two numbers A and M,
you are required to find B such  that it satisfies the following equation: (A*B)%M = 1 or (A*B) = 1(modM)

Here B is the modular multiplicative inverse of A under modulo M.

A and M are coprime i.e.Ax + My = 1 . In the extended Euclidean algorithm, x is the modular multiplicative inverse of A under modulo M. Therefore, the answer is x. 
You can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the multiplicative inverse.

For example, if A=5 and M=12, then gcd(A,M) = 1. Therefore, the inverse exists.

5*(5) + 12*(-2) = 1 (which comes from the extended Euclidean algorithm). Therefore, 5 is the inverse of A=5 under modulo 12.

/*
Another Approach: (used only when M is prime)

This approach uses Fermat's Little Theorem.

The theorem specifies the following: A^M-1 = 1(modM)
By multiplying with A^-1 both sides,the equation can be rewritten as follows: A^-1 = A^M-2 = 1(modM)

The formula for A^-1 is in the form of exponents. Therefore, modular exponentiation can be used to determine the result.

For example, if A=5 and M=11 then A^M-2(modM) = 5^9(mod11) is the inverse of 5 under modulo 11.

Time complexity O(log M)
When is modular inverse used?

Modular inverse is used to solve (A/B)%M as follows: (A/B)%M = (A*B^-1)%M After you find the inverse, you can solve this equation easily.
